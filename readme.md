## Alt-ijkl keymaps

This project contains config files with `alt-ijkl` keyboard shortcuts.
This keymap was inspired by Vim and gaming keyboard layouts.
One of the main goals is to navigate and modify text without moving hands over keyboard too much. 


### Differences compared to typical OS keymaps
Arrows are moved to `ijkl` and left/right arrows jump to next/previous word:
 - `alt-i` - line up
 - `alt-j` - move to previous word
 - `alt-k` - line down
 - `alt-l` - move to next word
 - `alt-n` - move left
 - `alt-m` - move right

Jump to start/end of line:
 - `alt-u` - move to start of line
 - `alt-o` - move to end of line

All of the above with selection:
 - `alt-shift-ijklmnuo` - navigate with selection

Delete/backspace:
 - `alt-d` - delete next word
 - `alt-;` - delete next character
 - `alt-shift-;` - delete previous character

Modes:
 - `alt-cmd-\` - toggle column mode
 - `alt-cmd-'` - toggle insert mode

Tabs:
 - `alt-q` - close tab
 - `cmd-shift-[` - previous tab
 - `cmd-shift-]` - next tab
