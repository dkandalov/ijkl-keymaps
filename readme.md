## Alt-ijkl keymaps

This project contains keymaps with `alt-ijkl` keyboard layout.
This layout was originally inspired by Vim and gaming keyboard layouts but it has heavily changed over years.
One of the main goals is to navigate and modify text without moving hands over keyboard. 


### Differences compared to default layout
Arrows are moved to `ijkl` and left/right arrows jump to next/previous word:
 - `alt-i` - line up
 - `alt-j` - move to previous word
 - `alt-k` - line down
 - `alt-l` - move to next word
 - `alt-n` - move left
 - `alt-m` - move right

Jump to start/end of line:
 - `alt-u` - move to start of line
 - `alt-o` - move to end of line

All of the above with selection:
 - `alt-shift-ijklmnuo` - navigate with selection

Delete/backspace:
 - `alt-d` - delete next word
 - `alt-;` - delete next character
 - `alt-shift-;` - delete previous character

Modes:
 - `alt-cmd-\` - toggle column mode
 - `alt-cmd-'` - toggle insert mode

Tabs:
 - `alt-q` - close tab
 - `cmd-shift-[` - previous tab
 - `cmd-shift-]` - next tab
